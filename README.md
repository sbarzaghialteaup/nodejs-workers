# nodejs-workers
How to use nodejs worker threads.

How to use this example
-----------------------
Start the backend with:  
`node index.js`

Via a REST client (Browser/Curl/Postman/Rest Client vscode extension) you can start to count up to a number, you can specify how many threads to use to count.

Examples with browser:

Count up to 10.000.000.000 with one thread:  
`http://localhost:3000/start/1/20000000000`

Count up to 10.000.000.000 with two thread:  
`http://localhost:3000/start/2/20000000000`

Count up to 20.000.000.000 with four thread:  
`http://localhost:3000/start/4/20000000000`

Count up to 20.000.000.000 with eight thread:  
`http://localhost:3000/start/8/20000000000`

In the console a progress bars is shown and a log is printed with the time in milliseconds spent to count and the percentage of used cpu:
```
Arrived request to count up to 20,000,000,000 with 4 threads
##################### - 5,262 milliseconds - CPU 51%
```

Internals
---------
When you ask to count up to 20.000.000.000 with two threads the program starts two workers counting up to 10.000.000.000 each.

```

When the number of workers is greater the number of logical CPUs there is a drop of the performance
